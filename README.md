This is a simple Whatsapp clone web application using React and Socket.IO for learning purposes. It was based on the Web Dev Simplified tutorial
which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBr-PybP_9c).

I've also made some UI changes from the original by applying Whatsapp's dark mode color scheme.
